Image saving is not working in IE 8 due to thelack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme">data URIscheme</a>; editing is not working in iOS 4. Nonetheless, on Windows,Safari, Opera, Chrome and Firefox are recommended anyway because the Javascript engine in IE 6/7/8 is far too slow and because `canvas' is not natively supported by IE 6/7/8. Rendering this tree on IE 8 is 100-fold slower than on Chrome/Opera/Safari.</p><h2>Usage</h2><ul>  <li>Clicking the white area in the canvas will bring up a popup menu, allowing you to:<ul><li><b>Draw</b>. Draw/redraw the tree with the current settings:<ul><li><b>Width</b>. The width of the image. For the rectangle view, the height of the image will be adjust automatically.	For the circular view, the height always equals the width.</li><li><b>Font size</b>. For the circular view, this is the maximum the font size. The actual font size	will be adjusted such that there is no overlaps between leaves.</li><li><b>Spacing</b>. The spacing between leaves. Not effective in the circular view.</li><li><b>2nd label</b>. The regular expression to match the secondary label of an internal node. Not effective in the circular view.</li><li><b>Pylogram</b>. Check this to ignore the branch lengths.</li><li><b>Circular</b>. Check this to switch to the circular layout.</li></ul></li><li><b>PNG</b>. Expore the tree picture as a PNG image.</li><li><b>Undo/Redo</b>. Undo the most recent editing. Only one undo is allowed.</li><li><b>Search</b>. Search for leaves matching a regular expression.</li></ul></li><li>Clicking a node will bring up a popup menu, allowing you to perform the following actions:<ul><li><b>Swap</b>. Click an internal node to swap its children.</li><li><b>Ladderize</b>. Click a node to sort the clade such that the	deeper leaves tend to be placed higher in the plot; in case of a tie, a leaf with lexicographically smaller names tends to be placed ahead.</li><li><b>Collapse</b>. Click a node to collapse/uncollapse all its descendants to one node.</li><li><b>Reroot</b>. Click a node to put the root in the middle of the edge between the node and its parent.</li><li><b>Move</b>. Click two nodes to prune the subtree descending from the first node and then regraft it to the edge between the second node and its parent.</li><li><b>Remove</b>. Click a node to delete it and all its descendants.</li><li><b>Multifurcate</b>. Click a node to multifurcate its parent node.</li><li><b>Highlight</b>. Click a node to highlight the entire clade. When a clade is highlighted, the Newick substring corresponding to the clade will be selected in the Input box. Given a huge tree, the selected text may not been seen in Opera, Chrom and	Safari. In this case, one may need to scroll back a little to see the selected text.</li></ul></li></ul><hr color="#cccccc" noshade="" size="1"></div><p><span id="n_leaves" style="color: gray;"></span><span id="runtime" style="color: gray;"></span></p><br><textarea id="nhx" style="visibility:hidden;">(((((((Unclassified)),(Sediminibacterium,(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Chitinophagaceae),(Reichenbachiella,(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Unclassified,(Unclassified)),((Unclassified)),Unclassified,((Unclassified)))),(((Unclassified,(Unclassified),(Unclassified))),Unclassified),Niastella,Unclassified),(((((Myxococcus,(Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),Unclassified,((Chondromyces)),((Polyangium,Sorangium)),((Nannocystis)),(Unclassified)),Algidimarina,(((Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),((Desulfotalea)),((Desulfonatronum))),((((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Unclassified)),Unclassified,(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Blastochloris),(Beijerinckia,(Unclassified),(Unclassified)),(Azorhizobium,(Unclassified)),((Unclassified),(Unclassified)),Unclassified,(Liberibacter,(Unclassified)),((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Terasakiella),Kaistia,((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Unclassified,(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Rhodospirillum),(Gluconobacter,(Unclassified),(Unclassified),(Unclassified),Acetobacteraceae,Asaia)),((((Unclassified,(Unclassified)))),(Unclassified)),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified))),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified)))),((((Unclassified),Fluoribacter,Unclassified),((Unclassified),(Unclassified))),Steroidobacter,((Halotalea,(Unclassified),Cobetia),((Unclassified)),(Saccharospirillum)),Unclassified,(((Unclassified))),Solibium,(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Allochromatium,Thiorhodococcus),((Unclassified),Alkalilimnicola,Natronocella,Ectothiorhodosinus)),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Thioploca)),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),(Unclassified))),(((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified),(Unclassified),(Unclassified)))),((((Unclassified)),((Unclassified)),((Unclassified)),((Unclassified)),Mitsuaria),Unclassified,(((Unclassified))),((Unclassified))),Unclassified,((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified)),Unclassified),Unclassified,((Macrococcus,((Unclassified,group),(Unclassified),Gracilibacillus,(Unclassified)),Salinicoccus,((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Unclassified),(Unclassified),((Unclassified)),(Thermoactinomyces)),((((Unclassified),Unclassified,(Unclassified)),(Heliobacterium),(Caldicellulosiruptor,Thermaerobacter),(Thermosinus,(Unclassified)),(Thermaerobacter),((Unclassified),(Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified),Thermosediminibacter,((Unclassified))))),(((Unclassified)))),(((((Actinocorallia,Thermomonospora),(Unclassified,(Unclassified))),(((Unclassified)),((Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),(((Unclassified)),((Unclassified))),((Actinokineospora,Lentzea),((Unclassified),(Unclassified),Saccharopolyspora)),((Unclassified,(Unclassified))),(((Unclassified),Parastreptomyces)),((Pimelobacter)),((Salinispora)))),(Unclassified,(((Solirubrobacter),Rubrobacterineae))),(Unclassified)),((((Unclassified))),((Unclassified),(Unclassified))),((((Unclassified,Ktedobacter))),Ktedobacteria),(((((Unclassified),Rhodopirellula,Unclassified,(Unclassified))),Planctomycetacia)),Thermolithobacter,Antarctic,((((Unclassified)))),((Unclassified,Chthoniobacter),(Unclassified),(((Unclassified)))),((((Unclassified)))),((((Unclassified)),(Oscillochloris)),Unclassified),((((Prosthecochloris,((Unclassified))))))),((((((Auxenochlorella)))))));</textarea><P style="color:#FF0000">Click the below area to display the phylogenetic tree in a customed way!</P><hr color="#cccccc" noshade="" size="1"><div id="canvasContainer" style="position: relative;"><canvas id="canvas" width="800" height="432"></canvas></div><div id="popdiv" style="width: 150px;
