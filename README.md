# MetaSee
An Interactive and Extendable Visualization Toolbox for Metagenomic Sample Analysis and Comparison


I did not find a web server to host this online service, and I did not find an opportunity to continue my work in the area of Metagenome.
So I am releasing the source of Metasee and the online service source code here. And this software is not under active development anymore.
